sp500_all_encoder_weights_4_6.pt = contains the weights of encoder for all the 300 training iterations
on the default sp500 dataset.

sp500_best_encoder_weights_4_6.pth = the weights of the encoder where the minimum loss was recorded.
sp500_encoder_losses_4_6.npy = all the 300 losses of the encoder
sp500_all_encoder_weights_4_6.txt = weights for all the 300 iterations in text document

sp500_trained_encoder_final_4_6.pth = this is the trained encoder with the saved state for best configuration.



4_6 means the latent_trash configuration i.e latent qubits = 4 and trash qubits = 6
